# Elegoo-Smart-Robot-Car-Kit-4.0-updated-Obstacle-Avoidance
The Elegoo Smart Robot Car Kit 4.0 hs an obstacle avoidance mode, were it tries to avoid coliding with obstacles. That, however, doesn't work so good. Sometimes, the Elegoo crashes into obstacles. But my code tries to change that, by giving it more advanced ways to avoid obstacles.
So, when no obstacle is detected (when the obstacle is more than 56 cm away), the car drives forward. When an obstacle is detected, but it's far away (when the obstacle is nearer than 56cm but farther than 36cm), the car slowly turns right while driving forward. when an obstacle is detected, and it isn't so far away (when the obstacle is nearer than 36cm but farther than 27cm), the car turns right faster while driving forward. When an obstacle is near (when the obstacle is nearer than 27cm but farther than 23cm), the car turns even faster while driving forward. When an obstacle is really near (when the obstacle is nearer than 23cm but farther than 15cm), the car stops and rotates (when no obstacle is detected anymore, it  stops rotating and drives forward). When an obstacle is extremly near (when the obstacle is nearer than 15cm), the car drives back for 1 second. (Caution: The car calibrates when you stard it with that code, so start it in a safe place and NOT on a table or something with a cliff, because it can't detect a cliff.)
